Telecom Power BI Report

This repo contains the Power BI report template file and a link to the published dashboard.

Files
- [TelCom.pbit](TelCom.pbit) — Power BI template included in this workspace.

Published dashboard
- Power BI link: https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/52172f8c-9760-4bb9-811a-cd996593ae0f/9aaad35214ab4e725e46?experience=power-bi

Notes & push instructions
- I can prepare the repository locally here and push to your GitHub if you provide either:
  - the target repository URL (e.g. https://github.com/youruser/yourrepo.git) and tell me you want me to push, or
  - a personal access token (PAT) with repo permissions so I can create/push (only provide if you consent).
- If you prefer to push it yourself, run these commands in this workspace root:

```bash
git init
git add TelCom.pbit README.md
git commit -m "Add TelCom Power BI template and dashboard link"
# add your remote and push, for example:
# git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-user>/<your-repo>.git
# git branch -M main
# git push -u origin main
```

Limitations
- I cannot push to your GitHub without remote access or credentials. The live Power BI dashboard cannot be "pushed" as a running service — include the repo link to the dashboard (above) and the `.pbit` file so others can import it into Power BI Desktop/Service.

What next
- Tell me whether you want me to push directly and provide the repo URL or a PAT (with consent), or tell me to stop here and I will leave the prepared files in the workspace.
